                <p class="white-text">Ten years ago we launched our Tree Report Card (TRC) - Casey Trees’ independent evaluation of D.C.’s trees.
                    We felt that if we provided basic information on the state of D.C.’s tree canopy to the public, elected
                    officials and the Administration each year, we could spark action to improve it.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="container">
            <article style="padding: 7rem 0;">
                <p>The TRC has largely succeeded as envisioned and two milestones stand out in particular. First is the city’s
                    adoption of a 40 percent Tree Canopy Goal, embraced now by three successive Mayors: Fenty, Gray, and
                    Bowser. Second is the passage of the Tree Canopy Protection Amendment Act of 2016. The Act strengthened
                    tree protections by increasing fees and fines for tree removal as well as created a permanently protected
                    class of “heritage” trees.</p>
                <blockquote class="wow fadeInRight">The city’s development boom is slowly eliminating the one thing trees cannot live without - soil.</blockquote>
                <p>But while progress has been impressive, a dark cloud lies ahead. The city’s development boom is slowly eliminating
                    the one thing trees cannot live without - soil. A total of 42 percent of the city’s land is covered by
                    impervious surfaces such as asphalt and rooftops - greater than the tree canopy goal itself.</p>
                <p>Therefore, I encourage you to get involved. Join us at a tree planting, become a supporting member or enroll
                    in our volunteer pruning corps. No matter how you engage, you will help us keep Washington, D.C. the
                    “City of Trees” for generations to come.
                </p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <article style="padding-top: 3em;">
                <p>Since 2000, D.C. has grown by 100,000 residents . While positive, an unintended result has been the addition
                    of asphalt and concrete - known as impervious surfaces.
                </p>
                <p>Impervious surfaces make the city hotter, more flood-prone and a less desirable place to live - and of course
                    more concrete means fewer trees. </p>
                <blockquote class="wow fadeInRight">To provide balance, we recommend that the District establish a maximum impervious surface percentage.</blockquote>
                <p>The good news is that there are new technologies that allow for trees to grow around impervious surfaces,
                    and programs that incentivize the removal of concrete and asphalt. But these mechanisms are not a comprehensive
                    approach.
                </p>
                <p>An impervious surface maximum percentage will guide future development, ensuring that trees and green spaces
                    are not eliminated as the city continues to grow.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 1em; font-size: 1.2em;">The Tree Protection sub-metrics assesses the impact of the city’s laws to protect trees and replace them
                    when they are removed. Specifically, the Urban Forest Preservation Act of 2002, and its successor, the
                    Tree Canopy Protection Amendment Act of 2016, levy fees and fines for tree removal and use those moneys
                    to replant trees to make up for the loss in canopy. The three sub-metrics are:</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"> 1. Are the fees and fines levied keeping pace with inflation?
                    <br /> 2. Are fees and fines being used to plant replacement trees?
                    <br /> 3. Are trees planted as replacements surviving?
                    <br />
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Averaging these three sub-metrics results in 95 percent, awarding the final Tree Protection an A.</p>

                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Coverage</span> is a measure of a tree’s crown when viewed from above and is the way we track the
                    progress that the District makes towards its 40 percent tree canopy by 2032 goal. The tree crown or canopy
                    produces most of the trees overall benefits.</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Health</span> encompasses trees condition, species, size, and type. This metric helps us understand
                    how resilient the District’s trees are in terms of potential threats due to pests and diseases. It can
                    also predict the longevity and future composition of D.C.’s trees.</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Planting</span> is a count of annual tree planting numbers compared to the total number of trees
                    that must be planted per year to achieve the city’s 40 percent canopy goal by 2032.</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Protection</span> assesses the impact of the Urban Forestry Preservation Act of 2002 (UFPA) – a
                    law intended to slow the removal of healthy trees 55 inches in circumference or greater and ensure their
                    replacement when they are cut down. Under the Act, removal of a Special Tree requires a fee (or fine
                    if removed illegally), and the proceeds are used for replacement plantings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Protection Sub-metric 1: Is the Urban Forestry Protection Act (UFPA) discouraging the removal of
                        healthy special trees? </span>With the update of the Tree Canopy Protection Amendment Act of 2016
                    (TCPAA), fees and fines for tree removal have increased. A decrease in permits granted was observed for
                    trees with a circumference over 100” (Heritage Trees). While we cannot ensure this decrease is due solely
                    to the TCPAA alone, it has been a huge stride in protecting larger rooted green infrastructure across
                    the nation's capital. Given these milestones in tree protections recommended by Casey Trees in earlier
                    report cards and the new baselines they establish, this sub-metric receives an A+ grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Protection Sub-metric 2: Are replacement trees effectively replacing canopy removed? </span>
                    Periodic assessments are necessary to determine if replacement trees are replenishing lost canopy due to Special or Heritage
                    Trees removal. For this sub-metric, we used our own tree survival study. Based on 15 years of growth,
                    we can determine that replacement trees are not only being planted, but they're also contributing positively
                    to the growth of the canopy, with a total of 85 percent of replacement trees surviving.</p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:900;">Tree Protection Submetric 3: Is the Tree Fund being administered properly? </span>The UFPA requires that
                    the District use the Tree Fund money—funds collected from fines and fees—to plant trees, ensuring that
                    the removed canopy is being replaced. An examination of the last fiscal years Tree Fund receipts and
                    disbursements show that these monies were indeed used for tree planting, resulting in an A+ grade.</p>
